Syntax to be parsed 

~ Creating a new table : 

new students :: int id , string name 

~ Adding data to the table : 

add students :: [1 , "Aryan"] , [2 , "Kumar"] , [3 , "Test"]

~ Displaying the data from a table (the outputs would in the normal command line interface , further in the project i would create a gui layer on top of the database
so printing a table would look like an actual table using gui)

print students

print students.name 


print students.name , students.id :: name = "Aryan" || id = 3

~ Removing data from table

remove students ~ would remove every entry from the table

remove students :: name = "Aryan" && id = 1 ~ would remove the entry which has name aryan and id 1


update students :: name = "Aryan" -> name = "Aryan Kumar" , id = 141 ~ would update the record with name aryan to name it aryan kumar and update its id to 141
